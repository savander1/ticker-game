Just a bunch of random notes about how to organize and play this game:

1. Stop just thinking of stock ticker, the game, and go for something that models the real world.
1. Create company avatars for stocks.
1. Players choose a quantity of stock at a certain value and keep that.
1. The game should be either turn based, or it could also be client/server/multiplayer or have both modes.
1. Stocks should move up and down on a set clock
    1. The stock movement should be determined by the following:
        > Level 1 Avatars {Stocks, Bonds, Commodities}
        >
        > Level 2 Avatars { Technology, Finance, Food & Beverage, Manufacturing}, {Government, Corporate}, {Metals, Energy, Livestock & Meat, Agricultural}}
        >
        > Level 3 Avatars -> this will include the individual avatars for each Level 2 avatar.
    1. At each level there is a random Up/Down "role of the dice"
    1. Each level 3 avatar has a risk quotient represented by a decimal _q_ where 1 &geq; _r_ &lt; 2
    1. At each level a multiplier is calculated using this algorithm
        > Given a random decimal _r_ where 0 &gt; _r_ &lt; 1
        >
        > multiplier = risk quotient *
