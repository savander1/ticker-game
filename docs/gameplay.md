#Game play

## Setup

1. Each player starts out with _n_ dollars. 
    1. Can use the money to buy stocks, bonds and commodities.
    1. A player may spend all his or her money, or can keep a some in reserve.
1. Stocks prices are set at an initial offering.
    1. This could be fixed (i.e. $1.00)
    1. This could be random, but should be in a range of n/2 +- 25% (roughly in the middle, but could be slightly higher or lower)


## Stock Behaviour

1. Once the game officially begins, the stocks increase or decrease in value at a given rate
    1. The rate could be variable (settings?) and look something like $0.10 per minute or $0.01 per second
1. Once a stock reaches a given value, they split (return to their initial offering and quantities double)
    1. This value could be fixed (i.e. $2.00) or a percentage of the inital offering
