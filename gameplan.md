Just a bunch of random notes about how to organize and play this game:

1. Stop just thinking of stock ticker, the game, and go for something that models the real world.
1. Create company avatars for stocks.
1. Players choose a quantity of stock at a certain value and keep that.
1. The game should be either turn based, or it could also be client/server/multiplayer or have both modes.
